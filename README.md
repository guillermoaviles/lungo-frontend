## Project Overview
Lungo allows users to sign in with their MetaMask wallet and display their NFT collections, view NFT details and attributes, as well as links to marketplaces. Users are also able to create a list of wallets they’d like to track in order to keep up with what other NFT investors are doing. After adding a tracked wallet, users are able to see the NFTs owned by that address and track changes in their portfolio.

## Deployment
The front-end of the application uses NextJS. The front-end follows the best practice in naming the components to be semantic. The front-end composes the following technologies/platforms:

### Vercel:
Vercel is the most accessible platform to deploy websites. By connecting the ** your GitHub repository** to Vercel, you can simply deploy the main branch to Vercel domains — and it does all the heavy lifting for you. **(Julian Wallis)**
